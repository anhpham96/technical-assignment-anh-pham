# Technical Assignment

## Introduction

This project is a Technical Assignment built using the MVVM architecture, combined with the use of module packages. The main packages included are:

- **CoreUI package**: Contains custom UI components that are commonly used throughout the application.
- **MPFilters package**: A package designed to use MetalPetal for image processing.
  
The project utilizes **Swift Package Manager (SPM)** for package management to streamline dependencies.

## Demo

### 1. CanvasView

The drawing algorithm is implemented in the `CoreUIGridDrawer` file within the CoreUI package.  
The `CanvasView` component is used in the `MainApp` to render custom drawings.

### 2. PhotoEditView
